# aagingpepred

AgingBasePEPred is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict whether a given peptide exhibits anti-aging or aging properties. Built with a focus on biological relevance and model robustness, the project leverages multiple ML techniques to deliver accurate, real-time classification through a user-friendly web interface.


The goal of this project was to evaluate various machine learning models on a curated dataset of peptides and identify the best-performing approach for predicting anti-aging potential. We focused on feature engineering from biological data and deployed the top-performing model onto a custom web server.
